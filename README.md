An innovative Augmented Reality application that transforms hand-drawn pictures into interactive 3D models, bridging the gap between physical and digital learning.

---

## 🌟 Overview

**AR Book** is an educational AR application that brings static drawings to life. Simply point your device's camera at hand-drawn images in a physical book, and watch as they transform into fully interactive 3D models with educational facts and information.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🎨 **Real-time Image Recognition** - Detects hand-drawn images instantly
- 🎯 **Interactive 3D Models** - View and interact with high-quality 3D objects
- 📖 **Educational Facts** - Learn interesting information about each object
- 🎮 **Intuitive UI** - Clean and user-friendly interface
- 📱 **Android Support** - Optimized for Android devices

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

The AR Book bridges physical and digital learning through cutting-edge Augmented Reality technology. Users can scan images drawn in a physical book (Sun, House, Car, Ship, Aeroplane) using the app, and once an image target is recognized, the corresponding 3D object appears on screen with educational content.
